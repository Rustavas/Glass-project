    <p class="forest__text">Løvtag’s three exclusive and comfortable cabins,
      Et, Ro and Ly, are designed by architect Sigurd Larsen.
      They all have an open space with a double bed, a double sofa bed,
      kitchen, separate toilet and an outdoor shower. On the roof,
      surrounded by treetops, there is a terrace, which is about nine
      meters
      above ground.
      The cottages are built around tall, old trees that go through the
      entire
      cottage from floor to ceiling.
